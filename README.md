# Hi, I'm Han 

I used to study **PHP**, but after a 2-year break, 
I’m starting fresh with **Java**. Most coding concepts are a bit rusty, 
but I’m excited to relearn, practice, and build new projects!  

## Current Focus
- Java fundamentals & OOP
- Small practice projects
- Improving coding skills from scratch
